# Credit Card Fraud Detection predicted by Logistic Regression Model

Thanks to dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)!

In this notebook, I have created a Logistic Regression model on imbalanced dataset to classify transactions as either fraud or non-fraud. This model is evaluated by Area under the Precision-Recall curve (PR AUC) and got a score of approximately 0.97 due to undersampling technique.
